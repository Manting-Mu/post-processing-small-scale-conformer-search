# post-processing-small-scale-conformer-search
A pythons script that reads in all the conformers generated via alternative softwares, such as openbable, rdkit or PCmodel, and clusters the structures to identify the most representing structure from each of the cluster for further small scale modelling. Note, this is an adopted version from the main Conformer Study script.
